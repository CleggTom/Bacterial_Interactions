    "In this notebook I run through the theory asociated with the microbial competition experiments. The basic idea is to develop a model which describes the temperature dependence of respiratory flux in communities with interacting species. This requires the model to not only describe the temperature dependence of metabolism itself (as classic MTE does) but also the change in flux that occurs due to the species interactions and their effects on population growth.

Temperature enters here three times influencing the intrinsic rate of growth $r_i(\\Delta_T)$, the strength of the interactions with other species and themselves $a_{ij}(\\Delta_T)$ and in the integral giving the biomass of each species $\\int_0^t C_j(t) dt = C_j(\\Delta_T,t)$. \n",
